# Minds and Machines Berlin Hackathon 2017

## Overview
The hackathon challenge and all logistics can be found here: https://mindsmachinesberlin.devpost.com/

Completed projects are due at 2pm Tuesday June 13th and must be submitted here: https://mindsmachinesberlin.devpost.com/submissions

This requires you create a devpost account in order to be eligible for a prize.

Europe is looking to lead the way to decarbonizing its economy and setting a global example. From the energy sector to advanced manufacturing and sustainable energy use, Europe is pushing the boundaries to drive sustainability and deliver better value. Develop new solutions on Predix to take decarbonization to the next level.

Your team can compete on one of the following challenges:
- **Electrification**
- **Advanced Manufacturing**

Each challenge gathers several datasets. Each dataset is related to a particular problematic. Your project can leverage one or several datasets.

Your team can also take up a **Developer Kit** complementary challenge using Intel board & sensors prototyping kit to improve your solution with a connectivity feature.

## Electrification Challenge
Presented by EURELECTRIC and EHPA.

Electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy, and electric building heating can drive decarbonization and economic value.  The grid needs to keep up!  Innovate solutions for electrification, and evaluate decarbonization impact. Sample solutions: Renewable energy resource siting; electric heating & conversion to heat pumps analysis; EV charger siting; renewable energy integration.

3 datasets are provided for this challenge. You can find detailed information about one dataset inside its dedicated folder.

List of datasets:
- **Grid GIS Dataset** Grid infrastructure mapping
- **Grid Timeseries Dataset** Load forecasting & temperature correction on distribution circuits
- **Heatpump Timeseries Dataset** Electric heating & conversion to heat pumps



## Advanced Manufacturing Challenge

Reducing the weight of aircraft components can drastically reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. This implies manufacturing a new generation of aeronautics elementary parts. Access manufacturing data to optimize manufacturing processes, and decarbonize flight by accelerating the commissioning of a new generation of aircrafts. Sample solutions: Forecast manufacturing delays based on parts complexity; detect delay drifts and optimize critical production rescheduling.

The manufacturing dataset is provided by Stelia Aerospace.

Two problematics are proposed with an increasing level of complexity:
- **Basic problematic** build a forecast model that can improve the estimation of production time for the variety of references Stelia has to manage
- **Advanced problematic** build an optimization tool that models Stelia queue management problem to compute the best production schedule
