# Minds and Machines Berlin Hackathon 2017

## Overview
The hackathon challenge and all logistics can be found here: https://mindsmachinesberlin.devpost.com/

Completed projects are due at **2pm Tuesday June 13th** and must be submitted here: https://mindsmachinesberlin.devpost.com/submissions

This requires you create a devpost account in order to be eligible for a prize. Please make sure you have consulted the requirements that are specific to each challenge / dataset.

Europe is looking to lead the way to decarbonizing its economy and setting a global example. From the energy sector to advanced manufacturing and sustainable energy use, Europe is pushing the boundaries to drive sustainability and deliver better value. Develop new solutions on Predix to take decarbonization to the next level.

Your team can compete on one of the following challenges:
- **Electrification**
- **Advanced Manufacturing**

Each challenge gathers several datasets. Each dataset is related to a particular problematic. Your project can leverage one or several datasets.

Your team can also take up a **Developer Kit** complementary challenge using Intel board & sensors prototyping kit to improve your solution with a connectivity feature.

## Electrification Challenge

*Presented by EURELECTRIC, EHPA, ESB and Fraunhofer*

Electric vehicles, distributed renewable energy, and electric building heating can drive decarbonization and economic value.  The grid needs to keep up!  Innovate solutions for electrification, and evaluate decarbonization impact. This challenge deals with: Renewable energy resource siting; electric heating & conversion to heat pumps analysis; EV charger siting; renewable energy integration.

3 datasets are provided for this challenge:

- **Grid GIS Dataset** Grid infrastructure mapping
- **Grid Timeseries Dataset** Load forecasting & temperature correction on distribution circuits
- **Heatpump Timeseries Dataset** Electric heating & conversion to heat pumps

You can find detailed information about each dataset inside its dedicated folder.

## Advanced Manufacturing Challenge

*Presented by Stelia Aerospace*

Reducing the weight of aircraft components can drastically reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. This implies manufacturing a new generation of aeronautics elementary parts. Access manufacturing data to optimize manufacturing processes, and decarbonize flight by accelerating the commissioning of a new generation of aircrafts. Sample solutions: Forecast manufacturing delays based on parts complexity; detect delay drifts and optimize critical production rescheduling.

The manufacturing dataset is provided by Stelia Aerospace.

Two problematics are proposed with an increasing level of complexity:
- **Basic problematic** build a forecast model that can improve the estimation of production time for the variety of references Stelia has to manage
- **Advanced problematic** build an optimization tool that models Stelia queue management problem to compute the best production schedule

**The jury will be particularly focused on projects that tackle the Advanced problematic.**

## Developer Kit

*Presented by Intel*

Your mission is to address one of the problems related to Electrification or Advanced Manufacturing challenges. To boost your project prototype you can add connected hardware with Predix Edge to your solution. For instance you can build a heatpump simulator using the Kit to generate real-time temperature data and use it in your Predix cloud space.

You can find detailed information in the "Intel Dev Kit" folder in this repo.
